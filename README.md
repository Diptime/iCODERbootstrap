iCoderBootstrap is a technology related website.The main purpose of this website is to solve queries related to software,
hardware, devops, competitive programming and Data Structures and Algorithms.

The deployed website can be found at :

I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend part of the website.
The frontend includes a Home page having navigation bar, options for login & sign-up and about and contact us pages.

For the backend of the website ,firebase has been used. The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database.
Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. The database has been used to store 
the queries coming from the user and also
